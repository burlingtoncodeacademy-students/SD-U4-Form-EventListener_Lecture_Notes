**Where's Waldo - Broken Program**

Sometimes we are handed code that is just broken and it's up to us to fix what has been built. This challenge is a semi-completed project that has various bugs within it. You will need to track the error messages within the browser and use VS Code to help track the errors within.

Go to this [repo](https://github.com/burlingtoncodeacademy-students/U4_BrokenApp_Waldo_Student) and fork it to your own account. Review the `ReadMe.md` within that repo for further instructions.
